			    We have prepared for you 5 interesting and useful tips for a sustainable and easy marriage/relationship:
			<p> 1) Make an effort to love your partner selflessly;
			<p> 2) Sometimes see things from a loved one's perspective;
			<p> 3) Make enough time for love!;
			<p> 4) Communicate with each other, talk, try to understand your partner, his thoughts and wishes.
			<p>    Good communication is one of the prerequisites for a happy relationship.
			<p> 5) Give each other a break. Even in the strongest and very close relationships, it is necessary for the partners to dedicate a certain amount of time exclusively to themselves, forming themselves as independent individuals.
			<p> All in all, one should prefer LOVE, LOVE and ONLY LOVE!!!
