        <h2>Quick Start Guide</h2>
        <p>
        <p>Welcome to the TAS Dating Quick Start Guide!
        <br>As a reputable company, we suggest you to read briefly about the actual use of the site and applications.
        <br>As for using the TAS Dating site (www.tasdating.com), users have an excellent short form
        called "FIND YOUR LOVE" and when exactly fills can send information that is very important
        to our user experience, and users can dive deep into our app that is available on all
        platforms!
        </br>
        <h2>Create a user profile!</h2>
        <p>Before we explain how to properly create a user account, we are obliged to inform that
        minors respect the word of the site and the application, that is, if they are under the age of
        eighteen, they should not use our services!
        <br>To create a user account on our application, you need to decide what gender you are, what
        nationality you are, what you do, what your hobby is, which person to hang out with or what
        kind of partner you want to meet, etc...
        <br>Once you go through all the questions, the application asks you to select a method to
        successfully log in as a user. This means you choose what you use to create your account, and
        the options are: Sign in with your mobile number, sign in with your Google account, or sign
        in with your Facebook account.
        <br>Once you've gone through the steps we've outlined, you should be successfully logged in,

    <h2>Tips for a better experience!</h2>
    <p>A better experience follows immediately after successful registration on our application!
    <br>Fasten your seat belts because TAS Dating offers you a user experience unlike any other
    dating platform!
    <br>Upon successful login, users have a completely open interface that they can explore because
    we do not only offer swiping in the application, but also the option of free internet calls and
    video calls like whatsapp, we also offer a magic button called "Connections" that allows
    partners to connect all over the world and upload their favorite videos recordings about life
    that do not violate our principles. Joy and happiness are the most important here, so we ask
    all users who would like to share videos to the public to share everything except dangerous,
    unpleasant, criminal and sexual video material.</p>

    <h2>Show yourself who you are!</h2>
    <p>To show yourself who you really are, it's important to be polite and honest with other online
    users!
    <br>Do what makes you happy in life, and we will agree that it is meeting new people, running,
    reading a book, swimming, etc.. Be kind to others and if you explicit video recording makes
    happy do it BUT when both genders agree and in your private chat. If the other partner of the
    opposite or same sex feels uncomfortable or threatened, please delete the content from the
    platform!. Don't judge others by their physical appearance because none of us in the world is
    perfect! Give a chance and opportunity to anyone who would give you the same. Don't
    disturb other users because you will make us not like you as a user at all and we can very
    quickly and easily permanently ban you ban from the platform. As always, only the sincere
    and true love of the community that fills the planet earth with wonderful feelings is welcome
    here!
